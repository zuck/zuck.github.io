Whistleblowing is a concept of recent introduction according to which, as the term suggests, anyone, internally or externally to the organization in which they work, tries to bring to light an error or incorrect behavior detected during the performance of their professional duties.

The reporting of incorrect behavior can obviously involve ethical and psychological aspects, the relationship with colleagues and employers, public opinion and the social environment, taking into account the repercussions that can easily be created and that the employees of public bodies are often the first to be able to detect irregularities occurring at the workplace.

I collaborated with [Issos srl](http://www.issos.it/page/26/index.html) to design and develop a complete solution to _whistleblowing_, already used in production by several public offices and agencies.
