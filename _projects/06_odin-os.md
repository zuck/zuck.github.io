ODIN OS™ is an open-source Linux-based operative system used on pinKey™ Touch devices.

It's specifically designed for safety devices based on the user's fingerprint recognition.

By providing an open development platform, ODIN OS™ offers developers the opportunity to build extremely rich and innovative applications designed for security services like data storage, electronic payments, access control or user identification.

All applications running on ODIN OS™ can access to sensitive information only after a valid user's fingerprint recognition. It also provides support for plausible deniability to protect the critical data when the user is under the menace of a prowler.
