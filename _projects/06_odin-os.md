**ODIN OS™** is an open-source Linux-based operative system used on _pinKey™ Touch_ devices by [Card Tech srl].

It's specifically designed for safety devices based on the user's fingerprint recognition.

By providing an open development platform, ODIN OS™ offers developers the opportunity to build extremely rich and innovative applications designed for security services like data storage, electronic payments, access control or user identification.

All applications running on ODIN OS™ can access to sensitive information only after a valid user's fingerprint recognition. It also provides support for plausible deniability to protect the critical data when the user is under the menace of a prowler.

## Main characteristics

* **Linux-based:** the system relies heavily on the robust and trustworthy Linux kernel.
* **Security-oriented:** users can access critical information only after biometric authentication.
* **NFC-enabled:** it provides a powerful software stack for Near Field Communication technology.
* **Rich-application-designed:** it can accommodate endless applications, one for every need, with rich and dynamic user interfaces based on _Qt Quick_ Technology.

## General architecture

Following the pattern of several other embedded operative systems, the ODIN OS™ is based on three logical layers, described below.
